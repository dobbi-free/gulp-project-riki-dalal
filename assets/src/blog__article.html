                        for your wedding dress neckline entails more than just picking a hairdo that looks
                        beautiful. Choosing the best wedding hairstyle should get as much attention as
                        choosing a wedding date and venue. Your hairdo should beautifully compliment
                        your wedding dress neckline, accentuating the amazing and unique details and
                        show off your best features. From a bun and ponytail to side hairdos and down and
                        loose, we have the perfect wedding dress neckline & hairstyle matches for romantic
                        and soft or classy and graceful looks:</p>
                    <h4>Strapless – Up in a bun or ponytail</h4>
                    <p> Up in a bun or ponytail style will keep all eyes on both the beautiful dress
                        neckline detailing, and show off your shoulders gracefully. A strapless wedding

                        around from reception to the dance floor. A loose braid will also be a great choice
                        for a romantic touch.</p>

                <h4>Dramatic Back – Updo</h4>

                <p> Choosing an open back dress style means you are bold, daring and you’ve got a very special and
                    extraordinary style, so if you’ve got a killer
                    back – show it off with your hair up. A classic bun, ponytail or fishtail braid, will accentuate
                    your back, and add a bit of a sensual touch to a tradition
                    themed wedding.</p>

                <p> Finding the right dress is a wonderful journey that begins at setting the date for the big
                    day, choosing the wedding venue and theme. Every
                    detail in your special day should reflect your style and personality, especially the dress
                    and hairstyle. Your wedding gown, accessories and hairstyle
                    should match and complement each other beautifully and effortlessly, accentuating your best
                    features and make you feel comfortable on this
                    beautiful celebration.
